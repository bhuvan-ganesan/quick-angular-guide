## Angular Data Binding
where the data stays in sync between the component and the view. Whenever the user updates the data in the view, Angular updates the component. When the component gets new data, the Angular updates the view.

###Data Binding in Angular

The data binding in Angular can be broadly classified into two groups. One way binding or two-way binding

###One way binding

In one way binding data flows from one direction. Either from view to component or from component to view.

###From Component to View

To bind data from component to view, we make use of **Interpolation** & **Property Binding**.

## Interpolation 
Interpolation allows us to include expressions as part of any string literal, which we use in our HTML. The angular evaluates the expressions into a string and replaces it in the original string and updates the view. You can use interpolation wherever you use a string literal in the view

The Angular uses the {{ }} (double curly braces) in the template to denote the interpolation. The syntax is as shown below

```sh
{{ templateExpression }}
```

The content inside the double braces is called Template Expression

The Angular first evaluates the Template Expression and converts it into a string. Then it replaces Template expression with the result in the original string in the HTML. Whenever the template expression changes, the Angular updates the original string again

### Ways to use 

**Interpolation is one-way binding**
Interpolation is one way as values go from the component to the template. When the component values change, the Angular updates the view. But if the values changes in the view components are not updated.

**The expression must result in a string**
Interpolation expression must result in a string. If we return an object it will not work. If you want to bind the expression that is other than a string (for example – boolean), then Property Binding is the best option.

**Should not change the state of the app**
You can't use JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects, including:

Assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)
Operators such as new, typeof, or instanceof
Chaining expressions with ; or ,
The increment and decrement operators ++ and --
Some of the ES2015+ operators
Other notable differences from JavaScript syntax include:

No support for the bitwise operators such as | and &
New template expression operators, such as |

**Invoke a method in the component**
```sh
{{getTitle()}}
 
//Component
title = 'Interpolation';
getTitle(): string {
     return this.title;
 }
```

**Concatenate two string**
```sh
<p>Welcome to {{title}}</p>
<p>{{ 'Hello & Welcome to '+ ' Angular Interpolation '}}</p>
<p>Welcome {{firstName}}, {{lastName}}</p>
<p>Welcome {{getFirstName()}}, {{getLastName()}}</p>
```
**Mathematical operations**

```sh
<p>100x80 = {{100*80}}</p>
<p>Largest: {{max(100, 200)}}</p>
 
//Component
max(first: number, second: number): number {
  return Math.max(first, second);
}
```
**Bind to an element property**
```sh
<p>Show me <span class = "{{giveMeRed}}">red</span></p>
<p style.color={{giveMeRed}}>This is red</p>
```
**Some Examples**
```sh
//Image source
<div><img src="{{itemImageUrl}}"></div>

//Href
<a href="/product/{{productID}}">{{productName}}</a>

//Template reference variable
<label>Enter Your Name</label>
<input (keyup)="0" #name>
<p>Welcome {{name.value}} </p>

//NgNonBindable
Use ngNonBindable to tell Angular not to compile or bind the contents of the current DOM element. I.e any expression is not evaluated but shown as it is.
<p>Evaluate: {{variable}}</p>
<p ngNonBindable>Do not evaluate: {{variable}}</p> 
<p>Angular uses {{ variable }} syntax for Interpolation</p>
<p ngNonBindable>Angular uses {{ variable }} syntax for Interpolation</p>

//Pipes
<p>uppercase pipe: {{title | uppercase}}</p>
<p>pipe chain: {{title | uppercase | lowercase}}</p>
<p>json pipe: {{items | json}}</p>

//Safe navigation operator ( ? )
<p>The item name is: {{nullItem.Name}}</p>     
TypeError: Cannot read property 'itemName' of undefined


<p>The null item name is {{nullItem?.itemName}}</p>
 

```

## Property binding

Property binding is one way from component to view. It lets you set a property of an element in the view to property in the component. You can set the properties such as class, href, src, textContent, etc using property binding. You can also use it to set the properties of custom components or directives (properties decorated with @Input).

```sh
[binding-target]=”binding-source”
```

**Should not change the state of the app**
You can't use JavaScript expressions that have or promote side effects, including:

Assignments (=, +=, -=, ...)
Operators such as new, typeof, or instanceof
Chaining expressions with ; or ,
The increment and decrement operators ++ and --
Some of the ES2015+ operators
Other notable differences from JavaScript syntax include:

No support for the bitwise operators such as | and &
New template expression operators, such as |



**Property name in camel case**
There are few element property names in the camel case, while their corresponding attributes are not. For example rowSpan & colSpan properties of the table are in the camel case. The HTML attributes are all lowercase (rowspan & colspan)

**Remember the brackets**
The brackets, [], tell Angular to evaluate the template expression. If you omit the brackets, Angular treats the expression as a constant string and initializes the target property with that string:

## Class binding 
Class binding is used to add or remove classes to and from the HTML elements. You can add CSS Classes conditionally to an element, hence creating a dynamically styled element.

The Angular provides the three ways to add/remove classes to and from the element. One using the DOM ClassName Property. The second option is to use the Class shorthand. The third option is to use the NgClass directive, which is covered in a separate session

**Class binding with ClassName**
```sh
<div [className]="'red'">Test</div>

<div [className]="'red size20'">Test</div>
```
**HTML Class attribute**
```sh
<div class="red">red</div>

<div class="red" [className]="'size20'">red</div>
```
**Conditionally apply Classes**
```sh
cssStringVar: string= 'red size20';
<div [className]="cssStringVar">Test</div>
 
getClass() {
  return 'red';
}
<div [className]="getClass()">getClass</div>

// Conditional (Ternary) Operator.
<div [className]="hasError() ? 'red' : 'size20'"> conditonal operator </div>
```
**Class binding with Class**
```sh 
<div [class.red]="true" [class.size20]="true">Test</div>

// Conditionally binding class
 hasError:false;
<div [class.red]="hasError" [class.size20]="hasError">Test</div>
```

## Style binding Example
```sh
<p [style.color]="'red'">Give me red</p>
<p [style.background-color]="'grey'">some paragraph with grey background</p>
<button [style.border]="'5px solid yellow'">Save</button

// Conditionally 
<button [style.color]="status=='error' ? 'red': 'blue'">Button 1</button> 

// Units
//The style property name can be written in either dash-case (font-size), as shown in above example, or camelCase (fontSize) as shown below.

<button [style.font-size.px]="'20'" >Big Button</button>
<button [style.fontSize.px]="'20'" >Big Button</button>


//Multiple styles
<p [style.color]="getColor()" 
   [style.font-size.px]="'20'"      
   [style.background-color]="status=='error' ? 'red': 'blue'">
   paragraph with multiple styles
</p>

```

there are alternative binding like **ngClass** , **ngStyle** will learn in directive session
